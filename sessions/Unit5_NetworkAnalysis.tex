\begin{frame}{Introduction: The concept}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Network analysis provides a framework for the study of a special class of linear programming problems that can be modeled as network programs.
  \item Some of these problems correspond to a physical or geographical network of elements within a system, while others correspond more abstractly to a graphical approach to planning or grouping or arranging the elements of a system.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph consists of a set of nodes $V$  (vertices, points, or junctions) and a set of connections called arcs $A$ (edges, links, or branches). 
    \item Each connection is associated with a pair of nodes and is usually drawn as a line joining two points. The graph can be defined as {\em directed} or {\em undirected}. 
    \item The {\bf degree of a node} is the number of arcs attached to it. An isolated node is of degree zero.
    \item In a directed graph, or digraph, the arc is often designated by the ordered pair $(A, B)$. In digraphs, the direction of the flow matters.

    \item A {\bf tree} is a directed connected graph in which each node has at most on predecessor, and one node (the root node) has none. In an undirected graph, we have a tree if the graph is connected and contains no cycles.

    \item A {\bf network} is a directed connected graph that is used to model/represent a system/process. The arcs are typically assigned weights representing cost, value or capacity corresponding to each link.
    \item Nodes in networks can be designated as {\bf sources}, {\bf sinks} or {\bf transshipments}. A {\bf cut set} is any set of arcs which, if removed from the network, would disconnet the sources(s) from the sink(s).
    \item {\bf Flow} can be thought of as the total amount of an entity that originates at the source, makes it through the different nodes and reaches the sink.

    Determine the maximum possible flow that can be routed through the various network links, from source ($s$) to sink ($t$), without violating the capacity constraints.

The {\bf maximum flow problem} can be stated as a LP formulation. 
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \text{maximize } \quad & z = f \\
    \text{subject to }\quad &
    \begin{array}{rcl}
      \sum_{i=2}^n x_{1i}= f&& \\
      \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_{in} = f &&\\
      \sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n x_{jk}, & \text{for } & j=2,3,\ldots,n-1\\
      x_{ij} \leq u_{ij}, & \text{for all } & i,j=1,2,\ldots,n
    \end{array}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\note{Constraints (1) and (2) state that all the flow is generated at the source and consumed at the sink. Constraint (1) ensures that a flow of f leaves the source, and because of conservation of flow, that flow stops only at the sink. Constraints (3) are the flow conservation equations for all the intermediate nodes; nothing is generated or consumed at these nodes. Constraints (4) enforce arc capacity restrictions. All flow amounts xij must be non-negative. Actually, constraint (2) is redundant\cite{carter}}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Maximum flow algorithm}
  All network problems here can be solved using the Simplex method, but the network structure can help us solving it more efficiently. In the {\bf Ford-Fulkerson labelling algorithm}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Use a labelling procedure to look for a flow augmenting path. If none can be found, stop; the current flow is optimal;
    \item Increase the current flow as much as possible in the flow augmenting path, until reaching capacity of some arc. Come back to step 1.
  \end{enumerate}

\note{ Let us assume initially that the flow in all arcs is zero, x ij = 0 and f = 0. In the
first iteration, we label nodes A, B, C, D, and G, and discover the flow augmenting path (A,
D) and (D, G), across which we can increase the flow by 4. So now, x AD = 4, xDG = 4, and f = 4.
In the second iteration, we label nodes A, B, C, then nodes E, D, and F, and finally node G.
A flow augmenting path consists of links (A, B), (B, D), (D, E), and (E, G) and flow on this
path can be increased by 4. Now x AB = 4, xBD = 4, xDE = 4, x EG = 4, and f = 8.
In the third iteration, we see that there remains some unused capacity on link (A, B), so
we can label nodes A, B, and E, but not G. It appears we cannot use the full capacity of link
(A, B). However, we can also label nodes C, D, F, and G, and augment the flow along the
links (A, D), (D, F), and (F, G) by 2, the amount of remaining capacity in (A, D). Now x AD = 6,
xDF = 2, x FG = 2, and f = 10.
In the fourth iteration, we can label nodes A, B, C, D, F, and G. Along the path from A,
C, D, F, to G, we can add a flow of 4, the remaining capacity in (F, G). So x AC = 4, xCF = 4,
x FG = 6, and f = 14.
In the fifth iteration, we can label all nodes except G. Therefore, there is no flow aug-
menting path, and the current flow of 14 is optimal\cite{carter}}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]


We aim to find the \textbf{maximum flow} from \( A \) (source) to \( G \) (sink) in the given network.

\textbf{Step-by-Step Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm}
The capacities of each edge are shown in the graph. We start with an initial flow of 0 and iteratively find augmenting paths until no more can be found.

\subsubsection*{Step 1: Augmenting Path 1}
An augmenting path is \( A \to C \to F \to G \) with a bottleneck capacity of:
\[
\min(8, 8, 6) = 6.
\]
We augment this flow along the path and update the residual capacities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A \to C: 8 - 6 = 2 \) (residual capacity).
    \item \( C \to F: 8 - 6 = 2 \).
    \item \( F \to G: 6 - 6 = 0 \).
\end{itemize}

The current total flow is now:
\[
\text{Total flow} = 6.
\]

\textbf{Step 2: Augmenting Path 2}
Next, we find the augmenting path \( A \to B \to E \to G \) with a bottleneck capacity of:
\[
\min(5, 10, 4) = 4.
\]
Augmenting this flow and updating residual capacities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A \to B: 5 - 4 = 1 \).
    \item \( B \to E: 10 - 4 = 6 \).
    \item \( E \to G: 4 - 4 = 0 \).
\end{itemize}

The current total flow is now:
\[
\text{Total flow} = 6 + 4 = 10.
\]

\textbf{Step 3: Augmenting Path 3}
We find another augmenting path \( A \to C \to D \to E \to G \) with a bottleneck capacity of:
\[
\min(2, 4, 6, 4) = 2.
\]
Augmenting this flow and updating residual capacities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( A \to C: 2 - 2 = 0 \).
    \item \( C \to D: 4 - 2 = 2 \).
    \item \( D \to E: 6 - 2 = 4 \).
    \item \( E \to G: 4 - 2 = 2 \).
\end{itemize}

The current total flow is now:
\[
\text{Total flow} = 10 + 2 = 12.
\]

\textbf{Step 4: No More Augmenting Paths}
At this point, no more augmenting paths exist in the residual network. The algorithm terminates.

\textbf{Maximum Flow}
The maximum flow from \( A \) to \( G \) is:
\[
\boxed{12}.
\]

\textbf{Verification: Flow Conservation and Saturation}
We verify that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Flow conservation} holds at all intermediate nodes (\( B, C, D, E, F \)).
    \item The flows on edges do not exceed their capacities.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In any network, there is always a bottleneck that in some sense impedes the flow through the network. 
    \item The total capacity of the bottleneck is an upper bound on the total flow in the network. 
    \item Cut sets are, by definition, essential in order for there to be a flow from source to sink, since removal of the cut set links would render the sink unreachable from the source. 
    \item The capacities on the links in any cut set potentially limit the total flow. 
    \item The minimum cut (i.e., the cut set with minimum total capacity) is in fact the bottleneck that precisely determines the maximum possible flow in the network (Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem): the capacity of the cut is precisely equal to the current flow and this flow is optimal. In other words, a saturated cut defines the maximum flow.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Multiple sinks and sources}

\subsection{{General formulation}}

\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{General formulation of the MCF Problem}
    \textbf{Problem Statement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Given a directed graph \( G = (N, A) \), where \( N \) is the set of nodes and \( A \) is the set of arcs.
        \item Each arc \( (i, j) \in A \) has:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A cost \( c_{ij} \): cost per unit flow.
            \item A capacity \( u_{ij} \): maximum flow allowed.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Each node \( i \in N \) has a supply/demand value \( b_i \), where:
        \begin{align*}
            b_i > 0 & \quad \text{(supply)} \\
            b_i < 0 & \quad \text{(demand)} \\
            b_i = 0 & \quad \text{(transshipment node).}
        \end{align*}
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Objective:} Minimize the total cost of flow:
    \[
    \min \sum_{(i,j) \in A} c_{ij} x_{ij}
    \]
    Subject to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Capacity constraints: \( 0 \leq x_{ij} \leq u_{ij} \) for all \( (i, j) \in A \).
        \item Flow balance equations: \( \sum_{j \in N} x_{ij} - \sum_{j \in N} x_{ji} = b_i \) for all \( i \in N \).
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Transportation problem}

\begin{frame}{Transportation problem}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Useful when there are costs associated with the flow, given a link capacity. 
  \item Let us assume that every node is a source (supply) and a sink (demand). Imagine a distributor with several warehouses and a group of costumers. Serving each customer from a given warehouse has an associated cost. \textbf{Bipartite graph}.
  \item For $m$ supply nodes, each providing $s_i$ suplly,  and $n$ demand nodes, each demanding $d_j$. Assuming that the total demand equals the total supply: $\sum_{i=1}^m s_i = \sum_{j=1}^n d_j$ we aim at satisfying the demand using the available supply minimizing cost routes.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
      \text{minimize } \quad & z = \sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n c_{ij}x_{ij} \\
      \text{subject to }\quad &
      \begin{array}{rcl}
        \sum_{j=1}^n x_{ij}= s_i&\text{for }& i=1,\ldots,m \\
        \sum_{i=1}^m x_{ij} = d_j &\text{for }& j=1,\ldots,n \\

    \end{aligned}

\begin{Exercise}
  Find the minimum cost in this trasportation problem:\cite{carter}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{transportationproblem2.png}
  \end{center}
  NOTE: The Simplex method says that we should first find any basic feasible solution and then look for a simple pivot to improve the solution. repeat until the optimal solution is found.
\end{Exercise}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Optimizing}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finding initial solution. Note that the network structure simplifies the solution by Simplex, as we do not need artificial variables nor, thus, a two-phase solution.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Northwest corner rule. Do not pay atention to cost. Always check $m+n-1$ cells (independent variables $\equiv$ non basic variables) for a FS.
  \item Minimum cost method. Start by minimum cost cell at every step.
  \item Minimum "row" cost method. Start in the minimal cost cell in the first row.
  \item Vogel's method (opportunity cost)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Transportation simplex
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transportation simplex}
  Once we have any feasible solution, we aim at finding the optimal one. Consider:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{transportationproblem3.png}
  \end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transportation simplex}
  We can reduce the total cost by reducing the individual costs in every row $i$ by $u_i$ and in every column $j$ by $v_j$:
  \[c'_{ij}=c_{ij}-u_i-v_j\]
  Check that, now:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\sum_i \sum_j x_{ij} c'_{ij}=0$
    \item Check how some costs are now negative in non-basic cells. 
    \item If we increase the number of units in those non-basic cells from 0 to some value, reducing at the same time the number of units in the basic cells, we can reduce the overall cost $\sum_i \sum_j x_{ij} c_{ij}$
    \item Reduced costs are now zero in all basic variables in the reduced system.
  \end{itemize} 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transportation simplex}
In practice:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We find first an initial feasible solution as explained above
  \item Calculate the $u_i$ and $v_j$, taking into account that $c_{ij}=u_i+v_j$, for all basic variables (used squares in the table). We start by assigning $u_1=0$.
  \item We calculate the {\em improvement index} by $I_{ij}=c_{ij}-u_i-v_j$ for all non-used squares in the table.
  \item If all $I_{ij}$ are positive, the solution is already optimal and we are done.
  \item If some $I_{ij}<0$, then build a loop with such value in the corner and alternative $\pm$ signs in all vertex. 
  \item Use the above $\pm$ to increase the number of units in the position that had $I_{ij}<0$
  \item We return to step 2.
