\begin{itemize}
  \item Getting familiar with the use of integer programming
  \item Solving integer programming problems
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The concept}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Problems in which the feasible set is composed of only integer values.
  \item The feasible set is neither continuous nor feasible.
  \item NP-hard problems in general.
  \item Integer problems that have a network structure are easy to solve using the Simplex method (assignment and matching problems, transportation and transshipment problems, and network flow problems always produce integer results, provided that the problem bounds are integers).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

That being said, there are some problems for which rounding can be effective. For example, in solving a problem for manufacturing tires, if the LP solution specifies making 1296.4 tires of a particular style, it is probably safe to round the answer down to 1,296 without drastically affecting feasibility or the objective function. In contrast, if the product being manufactured is a multi-million dollar aircraft, rounding is probably a poor solution. Rounding down a half a plane here or there could put a company right out of business.

An even more dramatic difficulty arises when using rounding for integer problems in which the variables are further constrained to have values of either zero or one. Consider a production planning problem for a large auto manufacturer such as General Motors, where it must be decided at which plants each car model should be built. A formulation for this problem might involve variables xij, each having a value of one or zero, depending on whether model i is produced at plant j, or not. Suppose there are ten plants, and each model can be assigned to only one location. An LP solution could easily recommend a small fraction of each model at each plant, yet rounding could produce a solution in which no models are produced anywhere. This situation is frequently encountered in integer programming; and in such cases, the LP solution gives virtually no insight into how to solve the integer problem.

Mathematical programming problems in which all decision variables must have positive integer values are called general integer programming problems. If all the decision variables are restricted to have only the value zero or one, the problem is then called a zero–one programming (or binary integer programming) problem. In that case, the constraints on the variables are sometimes called binary or Boolean constraints, and the model is often referred to in abbreviated form as a 0–1 problem. Variations on the aforementioned problems arise if some of the variables must be integer, others must be zero or one, while still others may have real values. Any problem involving such combinations is described as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. This section illustrates each of these types of integer problems with typical practical examples.

One of the most successful practical applications of integer programming has been in the airline crew scheduling problem. The airlines first design a flight schedule composed of a large number of flight legs. A flight leg is a specific flight on a specific piece of equipment, such as a 747 from New York to Chicago departing at 6:27 a.m. A flight crew is a complete set of people, including pilots, navigator, and flight attendants who are trained for a specific airplane. A work schedule or rotation is a collection of flight legs that are feasible for a flight crew, and that normally terminate at the point of origin. Variables xij have value 1 if flight leg i is assigned to crew j. The objective is to ensure that all flight legs are covered at minimum total cost. Most of the major world airlines now use integer programming to assign crews to flight legs, and many claim to be saving millions of dollars annually in operating costs.

\begin{frame}{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Systems of highways, railroads, shipping lanes, or aviation patterns, where some supply of a commodity is transported or distributed to satisfy a demand;
    \item pipeline systems or utility grids can be viewed as fluid flow or power flow networks;
    \item computer communication networks represent the flow of information;
    \item an economic system may represent the flow of wealth;
    \item routing a vehicle or a commodity between certain specified points in the network;
    \item assigning jobs to machines, or matching workers with jobs for maximum efficiency;
    \item project planning and project management, where various activities must be scheduled in order to minimize the duration of a project or to meet specified completion dates, subject to the availability of resources;
    \item and many, many others.

\begin{itemize}
    \item A graph is a structure consisting of a set of nodes (vertices, points, or junctions) and a set of connections called arcs (edges, links, or branches).
    \item Each connection is associated with a pair of nodes and is usually drawn as a line joining two points. The graph can be defined as directed or undirected.
    \item The degree of a node is the number of arcs attached to it. An isolated node is of degree zero.
    \item In a directed graph, the arc is often designated by the ordered pair $(A, B)$.

    \item If all the arcs in a path are forward arcs, the path is called {\bf directed chain} or simply {\bf chain}.
    \item {\bf path} and {\bf chain} are synonimous if the graph is undirected.
    \item In the second example above we saw a cyclic path but not a cyclic chain, as it included the backward arc $(C,E)$.
    \item A {\bf connected graph} has at least one path connecting every pair of nodes.
    \item In a {\bf bipartite graph} the nodes can be partitioned into two subsets $S$ and $T$, such that each node is in exactly one of the subsets, and every arc in the graph connects a node in set $S$ with a node in set $T$.
    \item Such a graph is {\bf complete bipartite} if each node in $S$ is connected to every node in $T$.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item A {\bf tree} is a directed connected graph in which each node has at most on predecessor, and one node (the root node) has none. In an undirected graph, we have a tree if the graph is connected and contains no cycles.
    \item A {\bf network} is a directed connected graph that is used to model/represent a system/process. The arcs are typically assigned weights representing cost, value or capacity corresponding to each link.
    \item Nodes in networks can be designated as {\bf sources} or {\bf sinks}. A {\bf cut set} is any set of arcs which, if removed from the network, would disconnet the sources(s) from the sink(s).
    \item {\bf Flow} can be thought of as the total amount of an entity that originates at the source, makes it through the different nodes and reaches the sink.

  \begin{block}{Maximum flow in networks}
    Determine the maximum possible flow that can be routed through the various network links, from source to sink, without violating the capacity constraints.

    Important!: the commodity is only generated at the source and consumed at the sink.

The {\bf maximum flow problem} can be stated as a LP formulation.
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    \text{maximize } \quad & z = f \\
    \text{subject to }\quad &
    \begin{array}{rcl}
      \sum_{i=2}^n x_{1i}= f&& \\
      \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} x_{in} = f &&\\
      \sum_{i=1}^n x_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n x_{jk}, & \text{for } & j=2,3,\ldots,n-1\\
      x_{ij} \leq u_{ij}, & \text{for all } & i,j=1,2,\ldots,n
    \end{array}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\note{Constraints (1) and (2) state that all the flow is generated at the source and consumed at the sink. Constraint (1) ensures that a flow of f leaves the source, and because of conservation of flow, that flow stops only at the sink. Constraints (3) are the flow conservation equations for all the intermediate nodes; nothing is generated or consumed at these nodes. Constraints (4) enforce arc capacity restrictions. All flow amounts xij must be non-negative. Actually, constraint (2) is redundant}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Maximum flow algorithm}
  All network problems here can be solved using the Simplex method, but the network structure can help us solving it more efficiently. In the {\bf Ford-Fulkerson labelling algorithm}:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Use a labelling procedure to look for a flow augmenting path. If none can be found, stop; the current flow is optimal;
    \item Increase the current flow as much as possible in the flow augmenting path, until reaching capacity of some arc. Come back to step 1.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In any network, there is always a bottleneck that in some sense impedes the flow through the network.
    \item The total capacity of the bottleneck is an upper bound on the total flow in the network.
    \item Cut sets are, by definition, essential in order for there to be a flow from source to sink, since removal of the cut set links would render the sink unreachable from the source.
    \item The capacities on the links in any cut set potentially limit the total flow.
    \item The minimum cut (i.e., the cut set with minimum total capacity) is in fact the bottleneck that precisely determines the maximum possible flow in the network (Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem): the capacity of the cut is precisely equal to the current flow and this flow is optimal. In other words, a saturated cut defines the maximum flow.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Multiple sinks and sources}
  We can generate a supersource or  a  supersink node with unlimited capacity and repeat the process of optimization as above:

\section{Minimum Cost Network Flow}

\begin{frame}{Transportation problem}
\begin{itemize}

  \item Useful when there are costs associated with the flow, given a link capacity.

  \item Let us assume that every node is a source (supply) and a sink (demand). Imagine a distributor with several warehouses and a group of costumers. Serving each customer from a given warehouse has an associated cost.

  \item For $m$ supply nodes, each providing $s_i$ suplly,  and $n$ demand nodes, each demanding $d_j$. Assuming that the total demand eaquals the total supply: $\sum_{i=1}^m s_i = \sum_{j=1}^n d_j$ we aim at satisfying the demand using the available supply minimizing cost routes.

\end{itemize}

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/transportationproblem2.png}
  \end{center}
  NOTE: The Simplex method says that we should first find any basic feasible solution and then look for a simple pivot to improve the solution. repeat until the optimal solution is found.
\end{Exercise}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Optimizing}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Finding initial solution.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Northwest corner rule
  \item Minimum cost method
  \item Minimum "row" cost method
  \item Vogel's method
  \end{itemize}
  \item Transportation simplex
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transportation simplex}
  Once we have any feasible solution, we aim at finding the optimal one. Consider:
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/transportationproblem3.png}
  \end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transportation simplex}
  We can reduce the total cost by reducing the individual costs in every row $i$ by $u_i$ and in every column $j$ by $v_j$:
  \[c'_{ij}=c_{ij}-u_i-v_j\]
  Check that, now:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\sum_i \sum_j x_{ij} c'_{ij}=0$
    \item Check how some costs are now negative in non-basic cells.
    \item If we increase the number of units in those non-basic cells from 0 to some value, reducing at the same time the number of units in the basic cells, we can reduce the overall cost $\sum_i \sum_j x_{ij} c_{ij}$
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Transportation simplex}
In practice:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item We find first an initial feasible solution as explained above
  \item Calculate the $u_i$ and $v_j$, taking into account that $c_{ij}=u_i+v_j$, for all basic variables (used squares in the table). We start by assigning $u_1=0$.
  \item We calculate the {\em improvement index} by $I_{ij}=c_{ij}-u_i-v_j$ for all non-used squares in the table.
  \item If all $I_{ij}$ are positive, the solution is already optimal and we are done.
  \item If some $I_{ij}<0$, then build a loop with such value in the corner and alternative $\pm$ signs in all vertex.
  \item Use the above $\pm$ to increase the number of units in the position that had $I_{ij}<0$
  \item We return to step 2.
\end{enumerate}
