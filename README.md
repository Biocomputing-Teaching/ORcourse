**Course:** Optimization and Operational Research 

**Instructor:** [Jordi Villà-Freixa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordivf/?originalSubdomain=es) 

## Course Description 

In this course we deal with Operations Research (OR), a scientific discipline at the interface of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, defined as the use of quantitative methods to assist analysts and decision-makers in designing, analyzing, and improving the performance or operation of systems. OR can be used in financial systems, scientific or engineering systems, or industrial systems. Its aim is to rationalize, simulate, optimize, model and plan the architecture and operation of complex systems that are increasingly present in industry and large organizations. We will focus on the optimization problem, and we will be using a fully practical approach, using Python/iPython, Colab and libraries like google OR, among others, as our main tools during the course to demonstrate and test what we learn from the theoretical sessions.
