# Course Description

In this course we will deal with Operations Research (OR), a scientific discipline at the interface of Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, defined as the use of quantitative methods to assist analysts and decision-makers in designing, analyzing, and improving the performance or operation of systems. OR can be used in financial systems, scientific or engineering systems, or industrial systems. Its aim is to rationalize, simulate, optimize, model and plan the architecture and operation of complex systems that are increasingly present in industry and large organizations. We will focus on the optimization problem, and we will be following a fully practical approach, using Python/iPython, Colab and libraries like google OR, among others, as our main tools during the course to demonstrate and test what we learn from the theoretical sessions.

# Prerequisites

Linear algebra, matrix analysis, basic numerical analysis, differential, and integral calculus.  Basic knowledge of Python programming and jupyter notebook.

# Learning outcomes
By the end of the course, students should be able to:
* identify specific problems of linear programming;
* identify and use techniques to solve an optimization or linear programming problem;
* implement specific OR algorithms.

# Method of presentation

Lectures and practical training: 
* Short lectures with appropriate visual support provide the theoretical content of the sessions. 
* Practical training will present specific problems to be solved using computational tools and algorithms in and out of the class.
Required work and assessment methods
